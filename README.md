Titanic Passenger Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This project delves into the exploration and analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset, employing a comprehensive approach to extract meaningful insights and make accurate predictions. Leveraging Python and popular data science libraries, I meticulously cleaned, transformed, and engineered features within the dataset, enhancing its richness and informativeness.

The primary focus of this endeavor was on addressing two distinct challenges - classification and regression. For the classification task, I developed a robust machine-learning model capable of determining the survival status of passengers in a given test dataset bereft of survival information. Through a meticulous evaluation process, various supervised learning algorithms were assessed, and the most effective models were identified to solve this classification problem.

Simultaneously, I tackled the regression problem, aiming to predict the fare of individual passengers based on pertinent feature values. Employing state-of-the-art regression models, I fine-tuned and optimized their parameters to achieve optimal predictive performance.

This project stands as a testament to the synergy between data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques in solving complex problems. By seamlessly blending data analysis with predictive modeling, I have strived to create a reliable and effective solution for understanding passenger survival patterns and predicting fare values on the Titanic. Explore the intricacies of the dataset, witness the evolution of features, and gain valuable insights into the application of machine learning for classification and regression tasks.
